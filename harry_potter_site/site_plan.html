      <h3>Fan Theories</h3>
      <p>
        There are stories, there are theories, there are consipracy theories and much more for this 7 book world. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Marauders Map:
        When the Weasley Twins introduce and gift the Marauder's Map to Harry, they confess they found it lying around in Filch's office. The consensus is that Filch confiscated the map from the Marauders and kept it in its office when he couldn't figure it out, perhaps believing it was a simple parchment enchanted to insult the user as a prank. However, this doesn't make much sense knowing the mischievous group. The Marauders could have easily gotten their map back — even if they had let themselves get caught by Filch.

        A theory about the Marauders leaving the map in Filch's office makes far more sense. After they graduate from Hogwarts, the map would be of little use to them. But they knew other generations of troublemakers would eventually end up in Filch's office, and naughty as they were, they would likely end up with the parchment in their hands. In this sense, they could continue their roguish legacy in the school. This theory might not affect the Harry Potter series as a whole, like other far more disruptive ones, but it's a cute wink at the Marauders' era that makes a lot of sense. 
      </p>
      <p>The Extension of the Deathy Hallows
        The Harry Potter audience knows about the Deathly Hallows from the eponymous and last installment of the series. The Deathly Hallows are three magical artifacts created by Death herself to trick the Peverell brothers: the Cloak of Invisibility, the Resurrection Stone, and the Elder Wand. Funny enough, by then, readers were already acquainted with three powerful and mysterious magical gadgets: the Pensive, the Veil, and the Mirror of Erised.
        The Pensive is an artifact that allows wizards and witches to see people's memories as if they were living in them. The Veil is a powerful item located in the Ministry of Magic. People can hear whispers from the other side of the Veil and crossing it will end in death, such as Sirius Black's case. Finally, the Mirror of Erised shows the viewers their deepest desires. Fans believe these three elements are also Deathly Hallows, created by Death as well to trick either the Peverell brothers or other witches and wizards. Taking into account how all of these elements could end with the eventual despair and death of the user, this is very plausible.

        Lily Potter Owned Crookshanks First
        Many theories have evolved surrounding Hermione's cat, Crookshanks. One of the most popular is that Harry's mom was Crookshanks' first owner. As most fans know, the Potters owned a cat that disappeared when Voldemort killed James and Lily. Some believe Crookshanks ran away from the Potters' home and was eventually adopted by Hermione, over a decade later.

        This theory could explain Crookshanks' overwhelming hatred for Scabbers since he would've known Peter Pettigrew before he betrayed the Potters. Crookshanks is an intelligent animal who could likely see right through Peter's Animagus disguise and probably wants to avenge his former owners.
